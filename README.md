# Example of issue in Svelte 5 UI Listgroup component

This project shows a small bug in the 'Listgroup' component of the svelte 5 ui library. The problem is that 'onclick' events of the items aren't correctly propagated.

Note that this project also contains a small fix to the problem (see the provided updated 'Listgroup.svelte' file).
